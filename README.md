# 🏠 Home Network Configuration Lab

This lab demonstrates the configuration of a home wireless network using a TRENDnet router.  
The setup includes wireless mode selection, SSID configuration, channel selection, and applying secure WPA2-PSK authentication with AES encryption.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Wireless network configuration
- Understanding 802.11 wireless modes (b/g/n mixed)
- SSID creation and management
- Frequency channel selection (Auto)
- Configuring WPA2-PSK security
- Applying AES encryption for secure Wi-Fi
- Router administration using TRENDnet interface

## 📝 Lab Overview

### **1. Wireless Settings**
- Wireless Mode: **802.11 b/g/n mixed**
- SSID Name: **Home Wi-Fi**
- Channel Selection: **Auto**
- Router Interface: **TRENDnet**

These settings ensure compatibility with a wide range of devices while allowing the router to automatically select the optimal channel.

### **2. Security Configuration**
- SSID Selection: **Home Wi-Fi**
- Security Mode: **WPA2-PSK**
- Encryption Algorithm: **AES**
- Passphrase: **H@rd2Guess**

WPA2-PSK with AES is the recommended standard for securing home wireless networks.
